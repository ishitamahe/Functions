# Functions
## Aim
To print your prn using functions.
## Theory
 A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put a repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put a repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. There are 2 methods to call a function: Call by value and Call by refrence. In call by value, the actual value of an argument is copied into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument. In call by refrence, the address of an argument is copied into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
## Algorithm
Step 1:Start. 
Step 2:Initialize a function of the data type long long int. 
Step 3:In the function, write the code to take the input from the user to get the prn. 
Step 4:Initialize a variable in main(). 
Step 5:Call the function for the value of this variable. 
Step 6:Print the output. 
Step 7:End. 
## Conclusion
In this practical, we learn about functions, how to initialize functions, the methods of calling back the functions and use of functions. We also used the data type "long long int" in this program because the input was a number which required a large data type to match its size.
